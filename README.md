This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This application is a history tool by students for students. It would allow for students to learn history, take short quizzes, and obtain information on how to approach writing on the topics. This web app also contains the ability for users to edit the information for others to notice. In order to edit the text, the user must sign up and sign in with a ".edu" email, with the account saved to the Firebase Auth API. 

*NOTE*: The editing features currently save the altered text by users in only one instance at a time, due to the web app being run on a local server. Community changes to the text can be viewed through live share on a localhost.

*To Run the Program*:
Write the following commands in the terminal

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
