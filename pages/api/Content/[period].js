                    'In 1620, nearly half of the Pilgrims died, within the first year of settlement, due to disease. However, as time progressed with little support from the English investors, the overall health and economic position of the colonists improved. Pilgrims further developed peace treaties with Indians around them, which enabled them to devote their time to building a strong, stable economic base. Although none of their principal economic activities, such as farming and fishing, promised them lavish wealth, the Pilgrims were only able to be self-sufficient for five years.\n' +

                    'The Pilgrims were a minority in Plymouth and yet had solidified their control on the entire governmental structure of their colony during the first four decades of their settlement. Before embarking on a voyage in the Mayflower, William Bradford required that all the adult males aboard who were able to do so sign compact promising obedience to the laws and ordinances drafted by the leaders of the enterprise. The Mayflower Compact has been interpreted as an important step in the evolution of democratic government in America.\n',

                    'The Puritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony, like the pilgrims, sailed to America to essentially free themselves from the religious restraints. However, what makes the Puritans different from the Pilgrims was that they did not was to separate themselves from the Church of England but, rather, hoped by their example to reform it. The civil government of the colony was guided by similar authoritarian principles. Men such as John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts Bay, believed that it was the duty of the governors of society not to act as the direct representatives fo their constituents but rather to decide, independently, what measures were in the best interest of the total society. Despite the authoritarian tendencies of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a spirit of community developed there as perhaps in no other colony. Although life in Massachusetts was made difficult for those who dissented from the prevailing orthodoxy, it was marked by a feeling of attachment and community for those who lived within the enforced consensus of the society. Roger Williams, the man closely associated with the founding of Rhode Island, was banished from Massachusetts because of his unwillingness to conform to the orthodoxy established by that colony. Williams showed distinctly Separatist leanings, preaching that the Puritans church could not possibly achieve purity as long as it remained within the Church of England.',

It was nearly impossible for England to predict what role Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Connecticut, but Rhode Island would play in the overall scheme of empire because of the diversity of the aims and governmental structures of those colonies. The Navigation Act of 1660, a modification and amplification of a temporary series of acts passes in 1651, provided that goods bound to England or to English colonies, regardless of origin, had to be shipped only in English vessels; that three-fourths of the personnel of those ships had to be Englishmen; and that certain “enumerated articles,” such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco, were to be shipped only to England, with trade-in those items with other countries prohibited.',

By the mid-18th century, most political power in America was concentrated in the hands of provincial rather than royal officials. These provincial leaders undoubtedly represented the interests of their constituents more faithfully than any royal official could, but it is clear that the politics of provincial America were hardly democratic by modern standards.',

In July 1758, the British won their first great victory at Louisbourg, near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. A month later, they took Fort Frontenac at the western end of the river. In November 1758, General John Forbes captured Fort Duquesne for the British after the French destroyed and abandoned it, and Fort Pitt was built on the site, giving the British a key stronghold. This lead to the eventual British victory.',
